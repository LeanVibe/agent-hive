# LeanVibe Agent Hive Demo Developer Guide Plan

---

**Summary of Current State:**
- Evaluated orchestrator instructions (`CLAUDE.md`), workflow protocols, subagent feature branch requirements, and integration guidelines for autonomous AI agents.
- Assessed all custom `.claude` commands and git hooks, summarizing their role in enforcing workflow quality and autonomy.
- Reviewed all markdown documentation, categorized and summarized structure, strengths, gaps, and improvement opportunities.

**Demo Preparation Focus:**
- Planning a developer guide for demoing LeanVibe Agent Hive, using custom commands to autonomously build a Medium clone project with agentic prompts.
- Identifying setup steps, CLI agentic prompt sequence, and implementation gaps/threats for prerequisites.

**Key Files/Areas:**
- Project docs: `README.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/CLI_COMMANDS_AND_HOOKS_REFERENCE.md`
- Agent/persona templates: `.claude/agent_CLAUDE_template.md`, `.claude/personas/orchestrator.md`
- Analysis reports, tutorials, archival docs
- `.claude/commands/` directory for custom commands, `hooks/` for git hooks

**Next Steps:**
- Draft step-by-step developer guide for setting up and demoing the agentic Medium clone, including CLI commands and agent prompts.
- Validate coverage/readiness of commands, personas, hooks, docs, and environment setup.
- Identify implementation gaps/risks and create a remediation prerequisites checklist.
- Expand any section, draft the full developer guide, or perform gap analysis as needed.
