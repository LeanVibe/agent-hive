review_checklist:
  authentication:
    - "Are authentication mechanisms properly implemented?"
    - "Is password hashing using secure algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2)?"
    - "Are JWT tokens properly validated and have appropriate expiration?"
    - "Is session management secure and resistant to hijacking?"
    
  authorization:
    - "Are authorization controls properly enforced?"
    - "Is role-based access control (RBAC) correctly implemented?"
    - "Are permission checks performed at all required points?"
    - "Can users access resources they shouldn't?"
    
  input_validation:
    - "Are all user inputs properly validated and sanitized?"
    - "Are parameterized queries used to prevent SQL injection?"
    - "Is output encoding applied to prevent XSS attacks?"
    - "Are file uploads properly validated and secured?"
    
  data_protection:
    - "Is sensitive data properly encrypted at rest and in transit?"
    - "Are API keys and secrets properly managed?"
    - "Is PII handled in compliance with privacy regulations?"
    - "Are database credentials and connection strings secured?"
    
  api_security:
    - "Are API endpoints properly authenticated and authorized?"
    - "Is rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse?"
    - "Are CORS policies correctly configured?"
    - "Are security headers properly set?"
    
  error_handling:
    - "Do error messages avoid leaking sensitive information?"
    - "Are stack traces properly hidden in production?"
    - "Is logging configured to avoid logging sensitive data?"
    - "Are error responses consistent and secure?"

review_patterns:
  critical_issues:
    - "Hard-coded credentials or API keys"
    - "SQL injection vulnerabilities"
    - "XSS vulnerabilities"
    - "Authentication bypass"
    - "Authorization bypass"
    - "Insecure cryptographic implementations"
    
  high_priority:
    - "Weak password policies"
    - "Missing input validation"
    - "Insecure session management"
    - "Missing rate limiting"
    - "Improper error handling"
    
  medium_priority:
    - "Missing security headers"
    - "Weak CORS configuration"
    - "Insufficient logging"
    - "Missing audit trails"

approval_criteria:
  must_pass:
    - "No critical security vulnerabilities"
    - "Authentication and authorization properly implemented"
    - "Input validation comprehensive"
    - "No hard-coded secrets"
    
  should_pass:
    - "Security headers properly configured"
    - "Error handling secure"
    - "Logging appropriately configured"
    - "Rate limiting implemented where needed"

common_suggestions:
  authentication:
    - "Consider implementing multi-factor authentication"

  authorization:
    - "Implement principle of least privilege"
    - "Use centralized authorization checks"
    - "Consider implementing RBAC"
    - "Add audit logging for sensitive operations"
    
  input_validation:
    - "Validate input on both client and server side"
    - "Use parameterized queries for database operations"
    - "Implement content security policy (CSP)"
    - "Sanitize output to prevent XSS"
    
  data_protection:
    - "Encrypt sensitive data at rest"
    - "Use HTTPS for all communications"
    - "Implement proper key management"
    - "Consider data anonymization for analytics"
