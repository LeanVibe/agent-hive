# LeanVibe System Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for the LeanVibe AI orchestration system, based on comprehensive analysis and Gemini CLI feedback. The plan follows Extreme Programming principles with continuous review and iteration.

## Critical Discovery
The project has a substantial existing codebase that was initially missed. Gemini CLI analysis revealed:
- Core orchestrator framework with async execution
- State management with SQLite + Git integration
- Complete directory structure with personas, commands, hooks
- Git worktree architecture already configured
- Agent configuration with specific capabilities

## Current State Analysis

### What Already Exists ✅
1. **Orchestrator Framework**: Async main loop with confidence-based decision making
2. **State Management**: SQLite database with Git checkpoint integration
3. **Agent Configuration**: YAML-based personas for backend, frontend, iOS, infra
4. **Hook System**: Pre-commit hooks, test enforcement, quality gates
5. **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Health checks, smart context management
6. **Dashboard Components**: HTML dashboard and unified views

### Critical Issues Identified ⚠️
1. **File Name Typos**: `task_disctributor.py`, `swuft_quality,py`, `dashboad.html`
2. **Missing Dependencies**: No `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
3. **No Documentation**: Missing README.md and setup instructions
4. **Incomplete Implementation**: Many classes referenced but not implemented
5. **No Tests**: Testing infrastructure missing despite test hooks

### Phase 1: Core System Completion (3-4 Weeks) 🚀 
**Priority: High - IN PROGRESS**
**Updated Timeline**: Based on Gemini review, extended to 3-4 weeks for quality implementation

#### Gemini Review Key Recommendations ⭐
1. **Vertical Slice Approach**: Implement one agent type (ClaudeAgent) fully before adding complexity
2. **External Dependency Resilience**: Add health checks, circuit breakers, and version pinning for CLIs
3. **State Management Performance**: Use hybrid approach (fast checkpoints + Git milestones)
4. **BaseAgent Enhancement**: Add `async def shutdown()` method for graceful cleanup
5. **Mock CLI Testing**: Create mock scripts for reliable, fast integration testing
6. **Configuration Management**: Add `config.yaml` for external settings
7. **Structured Logging**: Replace print statements with proper logging infrastructure

#### Revised Implementation Strategy
- **Week 1**: BaseAgent interface + Task Queue + Mock CLI setup

## Key Recommendations from Gemini Integration

### 1. Start with Code Audit (Critical)
Before implementing new features, thoroughly audit and fix existing code:
- Fix file naming issues
- Resolve import dependencies
- Complete partial implementations

### 2. Abstract Agent Interface (Architecture)
Create a generic agent interface to make integration seamless:
```python
class BaseAgent:
    async def execute_task(self, task: Task) -> Result:
        pass
    
    async def get_status(self) -> AgentStatus:
        pass

class ClaudeAgent(BaseAgent):
    # Implementation for Claude Code CLI

class GeminiAgent(BaseAgent):
    # Implementation for Gemini CLI
```

### 3. Robust Communication (Scalability)
Move away from file-based communication to prevent race conditions:
- Use message queues (ZeroMQ or Redis)
- Implement proper task acknowledgment
- Add retry mechanisms

### 4. Error Handling Strategy (Reliability)
Implement comprehensive error handling:
- Automatic retry policies
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Graceful degradation

## Development Workflow (XP-Inspired)

### Phase Planning Process
1. **Pre-Phase Review**: Review phase plan with Gemini CLI
2. **Implementation**: Execute phase with TDD approach
3. **Post-Phase Review**: Get Gemini review of implementation
4. **Iteration**: Incorporate feedback and refine

### Continuous Integration
- All changes committed to feature branches
- Automated testing on each commit
- Code review by Gemini CLI before merge
- Performance benchmarking on key changes

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Code coverage > 80%
- Performance benchmarks maintained
- Documentation updated

## Success Metrics (Adjusted for Reality)

Based on existing codebase foundation:
- **85% autonomy**: Achievable with proper confidence learning
- **<5% bug rate**: Requires robust testing infrastructure
- **<20% human intervention**: Needs excellent error recovery
- **5-10 features/week**: Realistic with proper agent coordination

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Integration Complexity**: Claude Code CLI subprocess management
- **State Synchronization**: SQLite + Git hybrid consistency
- **Performance**: File-based communication bottlenecks

### Medium Risk
- **Learning System**: Confidence threshold optimization complexity
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling scenarios
- **Scalability**: Multi-agent coordination at scale

### Low Risk
- **Documentation**: Straightforward but time-consuming
- **Testing**: Standard approaches apply
- **Dashboard**: Well-understood web technologies

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Run comprehensive code audit** on existing Python files
2. **Create requirements.txt** and test installation
3. **Fix critical file naming issues**
4. **Write comprehensive README.md**
5. **Implement missing orchestrator methods**

## Notes
- The foundation is much stronger than initially thought
- Significant cleanup and completion work needed before new features
