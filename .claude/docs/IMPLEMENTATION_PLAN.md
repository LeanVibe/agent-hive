## Implementation Workflow (XP-Inspired)

### Phase Planning Process
1. **Pre-Phase Gemini Review**: Review implementation plan with Gemini CLI
2. **Implementation**: Execute phase with TDD approach
3. **Post-Phase Gemini Review**: Get Gemini review of implementation
4. **Iteration**: Incorporate feedback and refine

### Quality Gates for Each Phase
- [ ] All tests passing before starting implementation
- [ ] Test-driven development for all new code
- [ ] Code coverage maintained >80%
- [ ] Configuration validation passes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Gemini review approval before proceeding

### Continuous Integration
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Run test suite after each significant change
- Update documentation as implementation progresses
- Maintain todo list status

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Legacy Cleanup**: Potential to break existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite as safety net
   - **Approach**: Incremental removal with validation

2. **State Management**: Complex serialization/deserialization
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive unit testing and validation
   - **Approach**: Implement with versioning for future changes
   - **Enhancement (Gemini)**: Implement atomic restoration with two-stage process

3. **Git Integration**: Potential conflicts with Git operations
   - **Mitigation**: Careful Git operations with error handling
   - **Approach**: Test in isolated Git environment first
   - **Enhancement (Gemini)**: Add robust error handling for Git command failures, dry-run option

### Gemini Review Enhancements

#### Architectural Improvements (Gemini Recommendations)
1. **GitMilestoneManager Robustness**: Include robust error handling for Git command failures, conflicts, dirty working directory. Add "dry-run" option for validation.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Design CheckpointManager and GitMilestoneManager to be injectable for better testability.

#### Performance Optimization (Gemini Recommendations)  
1. **Serialization Format**: Monitor JSON performance; consider MessagePack if speed/size becomes issue
2. **Compression Algorithm**: Evaluate lz4 vs gzip trade-offs for checkpoint compression

#### Enhanced Quality Gates (Gemini Recommendations)
1. **Linting Gate**: Add "zero linting errors" requirement using Ruff/Flake8
2. **Documentation Sync Gate**: Ensure relevant documentation updated with each change

### Performance Considerations
- Checkpoint creation should be <1s for typical state
- Checkpoint restoration should be <2s for typical state
- Memory usage should not exceed 100MB for checkpoints
- File I/O operations should be non-blocking where possible

## Success Metrics

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] All legacy components safely removed or reconciled
- [ ] 100% test suite still passing after cleanup
- [ ] No functionality gaps or regressions
- [ ] Configuration system fully operational

### Phase 4 Success Criteria  
- [ ] Complete checkpoint/restoration system operational
- [ ] Git milestone integration working
- [ ] Automatic triggers functioning correctly
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] >90% test coverage for new components

## Timeline Estimation

### Phase 3: Legacy Cleanup (6-9 hours)
