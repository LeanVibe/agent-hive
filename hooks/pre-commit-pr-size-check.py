ðŸš¨ COMMIT REJECTED - PR SIZE LIMIT VIOLATION

**STAGED CHANGES EXCEED LIMIT:**
- Additions: {stats['additions']} lines
- Deletions: {stats['deletions']} lines
- Total Changes: {stats['total_changes']} lines
- Limit: {stats['max_allowed']} lines maximum
- Violation Factor: {stats['violation_factor']}x over limit

**REQUIRED ACTION:**
1. Unstage some files: git reset HEAD <file>
2. Commit changes incrementally in smaller batches
3. Follow <500 line PR limits (Week 2 Strategic Plan)
4. Break down large features into multiple PRs

**WORKFLOW DISCIPLINE:**
Large PRs cause integration failures and review bottlenecks.
Submit manageable, reviewable changes.

Commit rejected. Please reduce staged changes and try again.
