## Overview

This document provides practical, tested examples of multi-agent orchestration patterns used successfully in the LeanVibe Agent Hive system. Each example includes the actual commands, timelines, and results from real implementations during Foundation Epic Phase 2.

## 🎯 Proven Orchestration Examples

### Example 1: Technical Debt Sprint (Solo Agent)
**Scenario**: Critical technical debt analysis and remediation
**Duration**: 2 hours
**Success Rate**: 100% completion, 90% complexity reduction

#### Orchestration Flow:
```
Main Coordinator Agent
└── Technical Debt Analysis Agent (worktrees/tech-debt-analysis)
    ├── Mypy analysis and fixes
    ├── Pylint compliance improvements  
    ├── Security vulnerability remediation
    └── Documentation updates
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

**Phase 1: Agent Spawning (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Main Coordinator creates worktree and spawns agent
git worktree add worktrees/tech-debt-analysis feature/tech-debt-cleanup

# Agent briefing with clear deliverables
Agent Role: Technical Debt Analysis Agent
Deliverables:
- Process mypy_report_fresh.txt (247 issues)
- Address critical pylint violations
- Remediate security scan findings
- Update technical debt documentation
Success Criteria: 
- Zero critical violations
- 90% issue reduction
- All tests passing
```

**Phase 2: Parallel Execution (90 minutes)**
```bash
# Agent works in isolation with regular updates
Status Updates:
├── T+15min: "Mypy analysis complete, 247 issues categorized by severity"
├── T+45min: "75% of critical mypy issues resolved, 0 test failures"
├── T+75min: "Security vulnerabilities addressed, compliance validated"
└── T+90min: "All deliverables complete, quality gates passed"

# Evidence provided at each checkpoint
Evidence Package:
├── Before/after complexity metrics
├── Test suite results (100% pass rate)
├── Security scan clean report
└── Updated documentation
```

**Phase 3: Quality Validation (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Main Coordinator validates completion
Quality Gates:
✅ All tests passing (pytest, mypy, pylint)
✅ Security scan clean (bandit, safety)
✅ Documentation updated and accurate
✅ No critical violations remaining

# Integration approval and execution
git checkout main
git merge feature/tech-debt-cleanup
git worktree remove worktrees/tech-debt-analysis
```

**Phase 4: Completion (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Results validation and documentation
Final Metrics:
- Issues resolved: 222 of 247 (90% reduction)
- Critical violations: 0 (down from 23)
- Test coverage: Maintained at 85%
- Security compliance: 100%
- Timeline: Completed 10 minutes early
```

### Example 2: Parallel Documentation Sprint (4 Agents)

├── Setup Documentation Agent (worktrees/setup-docs)
├── Context Monitor Agent (worktrees/context-monitor)
└── Integration Validation and Cleanup
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

```

**Phase 2: Independent Parallel Execution (5 hours)**
```bash
# Agents work independently with synchronized checkpoints
Coordination Timeline:
├── T+30min: All agents report initial progress and scope validation
├── T+2hr: 50% checkpoint - dependency validation and conflict check
├── T+4hr: 75% checkpoint - integration preparation and validation
└── T+5hr: Completion reports with evidence packages

# Cross-agent dependency management
Dependencies Identified:
- API docs need setup process validation (resolved via communication)
- Context monitor affects all documentation (coordination protocols established)
- No blocking dependencies found
```

**Phase 3: Sequential Integration (45 minutes)**
```bash
# Systematic integration in dependency order
Integration Sequence:
1. Context Monitor (foundational): 15 minutes
   ✅ Automated context monitoring operational
   ✅ Sleep/wake cycles validated
   ✅ No integration conflicts

2. Setup Documentation: 15 minutes

   ✅ All platform compatibility validated
   ✅ Context monitor integration confirmed

3. API Documentation: 15 minutes
   ✅ 100% API coverage with working examples
   ✅ Interactive documentation functional
   ✅ Integration with setup process validated

# Quality validation after each integration
Quality Gates Per Integration:
├── All tests passing (no regressions)
├── Documentation accuracy verified
├── Cross-integration functionality confirmed
└── No merge conflicts or integration issues
```

**Phase 4: Final Validation and Cleanup (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Comprehensive system validation
Final Quality Gates:
✅ All documentation up-to-date and accurate
✅ Single source of truth established (BACKLOG.md)
✅ All cross-references working correctly
✅ Complete system functionality validated

# Cleanup and completion
Cleanup Process:
├── Worktree removal: All 3 worktrees cleaned up
