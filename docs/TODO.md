# LeanVibe Agent Hive - Current TODO Items

*Last Updated: Following autonomous XP workflow - contains only immediate actionable tasks*

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS: PRIORITY 3.6 - Extract SmartTestEnforcer

### Immediate Actions (Current Task)

1. **✅ Extract SmartTestEnforcer from hook_system.py** (COMPLETED)
   - ✅ Target: `.claude/dev_tools/smart_test_enforcer.py`
   - ✅ Enhanced with multi-language support (Python, JS, TS, Swift, Java, C#)
   - ✅ Async test generation without blocking development
   - ✅ Comprehensive configuration integration

2. **Create comprehensive unit tests**
   - Target: `tests/test_smart_test_enforcer.py`
   - Test coverage: All methods and edge cases
   - Mock Gemini CLI integration for testing
   - Test async functionality without actual file operations
   - Test multi-language test generation patterns

3. **Validate extraction with existing tests**
   - Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
   - Verify all 70+ existing tests still pass
   - Check integration with quality gates

4. **Update imports and dependencies**
   - Check if any existing code depends on SmartTestEnforcer
   - Update import statements if needed
   - Ensure no circular dependencies

### Quality Gates (Must Pass)

- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] New SmartTestEnforcer tests achieve 100% coverage
- [ ] No compilation errors or warnings
- [ ] Gemini CLI integration works correctly
- [ ] Async operations don't block development workflow

## 📋 NEXT: PRIORITY 3.7 - Clean up duplicate orchestrator methods

### Preparation Tasks

1. **Analyze orchestrator duplication**
   - Review current orchestrator implementations
   - Identify overlapping functionality
   - Map dependencies between components

2. **Plan consolidation approach**
   - Determine which methods to keep/remove
   - Plan migration strategy for dependent code
   - Ensure no functionality is lost

## 🚀 UPCOMING: Phase 4 - State Management Architecture

### Ready for Implementation (After Current Phase)

1. **Create StateManager foundation**
   - Design centralized SQLite schema
   - Plan component integration points
   - Define state persistence patterns

2. **Integrate extracted components**
   - Connect ConfidenceTracker to StateManager
   - Integrate ContextMonitor with centralized state
   - Link SmartQualityGate to unified decision system

## 📊 Session Metrics

### Current Progress
- **Components Extracted**: 3/4 (75% complete)
- **Test Coverage**: 70+ tests passing
- **Autonomous Work Time**: 4+ hours continuous
- **Quality Gates**: All commits successful

### Success Criteria
- Complete SmartTestEnforcer extraction
- Maintain 100% test coverage
- Pass all quality gates
- Prepare for Gemini CLI review

## 🔍 Review Checkpoints

### Before Implementation
- [ ] Gemini CLI review of extraction plan
- [ ] Validate approach with existing architecture
- [ ] Confirm no breaking changes

### After Implementation
- [ ] Gemini CLI review of extracted component
- [ ] Validate integration with existing system
- [ ] Confirm readiness for next phase

## 🎯 Next Session Goals

1. **Complete current extraction** (PRIORITY 3.6)
2. **Gemini CLI review** of completed work
3. **Begin orchestrator cleanup** (PRIORITY 3.7)
4. **Target**: 4-6 hours autonomous work until human feedback needed
