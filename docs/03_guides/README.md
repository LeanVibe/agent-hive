## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Development Environment (1-2 days)
1. Follow [Docker Deployment Guide](docker-deployment.md) - Single Node Setup
2. Set up basic CI/CD with [CI/CD Operations Guide](cicd-operations.md)
3. Configure local monitoring and logging
4. Test deployment and rollback procedures

### Phase 2: Staging Environment (3-5 days)
1. Implement production-like Docker deployment
2. Set up full CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
3. Configure comprehensive monitoring and alerting
4. Perform load testing and performance validation

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (1-2 weeks)
1. Choose deployment strategy based on requirements
2. Implement security hardening and compliance measures
3. Set up disaster recovery and backup procedures
4. Configure production monitoring and alerting
5. Perform production validation and acceptance testing

### Phase 4: Operations and Maintenance (Ongoing)
1. Monitor system performance and health
2. Implement continuous improvement processes
3. Regular security updates and patches
4. Capacity planning and scaling

## Security Considerations

### Container Security
- **Image scanning** for vulnerabilities
- **Non-root user** execution
- **Read-only filesystems** where possible
- **Secret management** with proper rotation
- **Network policies** and segmentation

### CI/CD Security
- **Signed commits** and verified builds
- **Dependency scanning** and license compliance
- **Static and dynamic analysis** for security vulnerabilities
- **Access controls** and audit logging
- **Secret scanning** and rotation

### Production Security
- **TLS termination** and certificate management
- **Authentication and authorization** integration
- **Network security** and firewall rules
- **Compliance** with industry standards
- **Incident response** procedures

## Performance Optimization

### Container Performance
- **Resource limits** and requests optimization
- **Image optimization** and layer caching
- **Multi-stage builds** for smaller images
- **Health checks** and readiness probes
- **Horizontal and vertical scaling**

### CI/CD Performance
- **Parallel execution** of tests and builds
- **Caching strategies** for dependencies and artifacts
- **Incremental builds** and testing
- **Pipeline optimization** and bottleneck analysis
- **Resource allocation** for build agents

### Production Performance
- **Load balancing** and traffic distribution
- **Caching strategies** at multiple levels
- **Database optimization** and connection pooling
- **CDN integration** for static assets
- **Performance monitoring** and alerting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Container Issues
- **Startup failures**: Check logs, resource limits, dependencies
- **Performance problems**: Monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O
- **Network connectivity**: Verify service discovery and DNS
- **Storage issues**: Check volume mounts and permissions

#### CI/CD Issues
- **Test failures**: Check test isolation and data dependencies
- **Build failures**: Verify dependencies and build environment
- **Deployment failures**: Check permissions and network access
- **Performance issues**: Optimize pipeline and resource allocation

#### Production Issues
- **Service unavailability**: Check health status and load balancers
- **Performance degradation**: Monitor resource usage and scaling
- **Data corruption**: Verify backup and recovery procedures
- **Security incidents**: Follow incident response procedures
