## ðŸŽ¯ ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

When receiving this template, immediately:

1. **Acknowledge Assignment** (within 5 minutes):
   - Confirm understanding of deliverables and success criteria
   - Identify any immediate questions or clarifications needed
   - Provide initial timeline estimate

2. **Setup Working Environment** (within 15 minutes):
   - Create worktree and set up development environment
   - Validate access to all required tools and resources
   - Configure environment variables and settings

3. **Initial Progress Report** (within 15 minutes):
   - Provide first status update confirming setup completion
   - Report any setup issues or blockers encountered
   - Confirm timeline and milestone schedule

4. **Begin Execution**:
   - Start work on first deliverable
   - Maintain regular communication schedule
   - Escalate any issues immediately

**Remember**: Quality over speed. Better to deliver high-quality work slightly late than to deliver poor-quality work on time.

**Coordination Agent Contact**: Always available for questions, clarifications, and escalations. Err on the side of over-communication rather than under-communication.
