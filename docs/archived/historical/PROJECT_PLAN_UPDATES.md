# LeanVibe Agent Hive - Project Plan Updates

**Date**: 2025-07-14  
**Analysis Type**: Strategic Plan Revision Based on Technical Debt Analysis  
**Status**: Complete - Updated Priorities and Timeline  
**Scope**: Comprehensive project plan adjustment following gap analysis

## üö® Executive Summary

Based on the comprehensive technical debt analysis, **major project plan revisions are required**. The current plan assumes functional command-driven orchestration, but **70% of documented features are unimplemented**.

### Critical Plan Adjustments
1. **Phase 0 Required**: Documentation-Reality Alignment (NEW)
2. **Phase 1 Redefined**: Core Infrastructure First
3. **Phase 2 Delayed**: Advanced Features Secondary  
4. **Timeline Extended**: +3-4 weeks for critical fixes

### Priority Inversion Required
**Current Plan**: Build advanced features on unimplemented foundation  
**Revised Plan**: Fix foundation first, then build advanced features

## üìä Current vs Revised Plan Comparison

### Original Plan Focus
```
Phase 1: Advanced ML Integration        ‚ùå BLOCKS: No foundation
Phase 2: Multi-Agent Scaling           ‚ùå BLOCKS: No orchestration
Phase 3: Production Deployment         ‚ùå BLOCKS: No CLI interface
```

### Revised Plan Focus  
```
Phase 0: Foundation Fixes               ‚úÖ ENABLES: Everything else
Phase 1: Core Implementation            ‚úÖ ENABLES: Basic functionality  
Phase 2: Advanced Features              ‚úÖ BUILDS: On solid foundation
```
