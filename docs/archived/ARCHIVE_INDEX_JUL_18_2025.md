# üì¶ Documentation Archive Index - July 18, 2025

## üéØ **Archival Purpose**
This archival was conducted on July 18, 2025, as part of the documentation consolidation effort to create a single source of truth in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and eliminate scattered planning documents that were causing confusion.

## üìã **Archival Summary**
- **Total Documents Archived**: 8 documents
- **Archive Categories**: Legacy Planning (6), Communication Legacy (2)
- **Primary Reason**: Documentation consolidation and single source of truth creation
- **Status**: All information consolidated into root `ARCHITECTURE.md`
