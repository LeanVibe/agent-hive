## Performance Bottlenecks Identified

### 1. High Complexity Methods (Performance Risk)

#### Critical (Rank D - Immediate Attention Required)
- **`LeanVibeCLI.coordinate()`** - Complexity: 23, Lines: 96 (546-642)
  - **Issue**: Complex method with multiple responsibilities
  - **Impact**: Difficult to optimize, high maintenance cost
  - **Recommendation**: Extract smaller methods for specific tasks

#### High (Rank C - Should Be Addressed)
- **`main()`** - Complexity: 18, Lines: 98 (1066-1164)
  - **Issue**: Large main function with complex control flow
  - **Impact**: Testing difficulties, performance bottlenecks
  - **Recommendation**: Break into initialization and execution phases

- **`LeanVibeCLI.review()`** - Complexity: 17, Lines: 106 (678-784)
  - **Issue**: Complex review logic with multiple conditional paths
  - **Impact**: Slow review processing, hard to maintain
  - **Recommendation**: Separate review agents, validation, and reporting

### 2. Database Operations Analysis

#### SQLite Database Usage Patterns
- **Multiple Database Files**: 
  - `adaptive_learning.db` (53KB)
  - `pattern_optimizer.db` (29KB)
  - `predictive_analytics.db` (41KB)
  
- **Performance Concerns**:
  - No connection pooling implementation
  - Synchronous operations in async contexts
  - Multiple database files instead of unified schema

#### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Connection Pooling**: Implement SQLite connection pooling
2. **Async Operations**: Convert blocking DB operations to async
3. **Database Consolidation**: Consider unified schema design

### 3. Memory Usage Analysis

#### Current Memory Footprint
- **ML Models**: Multiple sklearn models in memory simultaneously
- **Data Structures**: Large dictionaries in adaptive learning
- **Caching**: No evident caching strategy for repeated computations

#### Memory Optimization Recommendations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Load models only when needed
2. **Data Streaming**: Process large datasets in chunks
3. **Memory Profiling**: Implement memory usage monitoring

### 4. I/O Operations Assessment

#### File I/O Patterns
- **Synchronous Operations**: Multiple file reads/writes
- **JSON Processing**: Large JSON serialization/deserialization
- **Log File Management**: Extensive logging without rotation

#### I/O Optimization Strategies
1. **Async I/O**: Convert to async file operations
2. **Buffering**: Implement intelligent buffering strategies
3. **Compression**: Use compression for large data files

## Performance Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Impact, Low Effort)
1. **Method Extraction**: Break down complex methods
2. **Database Indexing**: Add appropriate indexes to SQLite tables
3. **Connection Reuse**: Implement database connection pooling

### Short-term Improvements (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
1. **Response Times**: API endpoint response times
2. **Memory Usage**: Peak and average memory consumption
3. **Database Performance**: Query execution times
4. **CPU Utilization**: Processing efficiency metrics

### Performance Testing Framework
```python
# Performance test example
import time
import psutil
import pytest

def test_coordinate_method_performance():
    """Test coordinate method performance under load."""
    start_time = time.time()
    start_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss
    
    # Run coordinate method
    result = cli.coordinate(task="test", parallel=True)
    
    end_time = time.time()
    end_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss
    
    # Performance assertions
    assert end_time - start_time < 2.0  # < 2 seconds
    assert end_memory - start_memory < 50 * 1024 * 1024  # < 50MB
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Critical Refactoring
