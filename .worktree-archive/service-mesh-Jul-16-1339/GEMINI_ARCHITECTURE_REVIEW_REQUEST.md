# LeanVibe Agent Hive - Database Architecture Review Request

## Executive Summary
**System:** Multi-agent orchestration platform for autonomous software development
**Architecture:** Single SQLite database (`agent_hive.db`) consolidating 12 core tables
**Scale:** Expected 1000+ tasks, 50+ concurrent agents, 24/7 operation
**Performance Target:** <100ms query response, 99.9% uptime

## Current Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables Structure:
1. **agents** - Agent instance management (status, configuration, worktree paths)
2. **agent_messages** - Inter-agent communication system
3. **tasks** - Task lifecycle management with hierarchical relationships
4. **projects** - Project and epic organization
5. **context_sessions** - Context management for each agent session
6. **memory_snapshots** - Memory consolidation and archival system
7. **performance_metrics** - Performance tracking and analytics
8. **checkpoints** - Quality gates and project milestones
9. **git_state** - Repository state tracking per agent
10. **pull_requests** - PR lifecycle management
11. **configurations** - System and agent configuration management
12. **events** - Comprehensive system event logging

### Key Relationships:
- Agents → Messages (1:many for both sender/receiver)
- Agents → Tasks (1:many assignment)
- Tasks → Tasks (parent-child hierarchy)
- Projects → Tasks (many:many via junction table)
- Sessions → Memory Snapshots (1:many)
- Agents → Performance Metrics (1:many)

## Specific Architectural Questions

### 1. Schema Design Validation
**Question:** Are the table relationships optimally designed for an agent coordination system?
- Is the separation of concerns appropriate (agent mgmt vs task mgmt vs memory mgmt)?
- Should agent_messages and events be merged or kept separate?
- Is the parent_task_id self-referencing relationship in tasks table optimal for task hierarchies?

### 2. Performance and Scaling Concerns
**Question:** Will this schema handle enterprise-scale agent operations efficiently?

**Current Indexes:**
```sql
-- Agent performance
INDEX idx_agents_status (status)
INDEX idx_agents_type (agent_type)

-- Message routing
INDEX idx_messages_recipient (to_agent, delivered_at)
INDEX idx_messages_priority (priority, sent_at)

-- Task management
INDEX idx_tasks_status (status)
INDEX idx_tasks_agent (agent_id, status)
INDEX idx_tasks_priority (priority, created_at)

-- Memory management
INDEX idx_sessions_agent (agent_id, is_active)
INDEX idx_snapshots_session (session_id, memory_type)
INDEX idx_snapshots_importance (importance_score)
```

**Concerns:**
- Are composite indexes optimally ordered for query patterns?
- Should we add covering indexes for frequently accessed columns?
- Will JSON column queries (configuration, metadata, tags) perform adequately?

### 3. SQLite vs Alternatives Analysis
**Question:** Is SQLite the optimal choice for this multi-agent coordination system?

**Current SQLite Benefits:**
- Single file deployment/backup
- ACID transactions across all tables
- No separate database server to manage
- Excellent read performance

**Potential Concerns:**
- Concurrent write limitations with multiple agents
- JSON query performance compared to PostgreSQL
- Write-heavy workloads (messages, events, metrics)
- Future migration complexity if scaling beyond SQLite

**Alternative Considerations:**
- PostgreSQL for better JSON support and concurrency
- Hybrid approach: SQLite for config/state, time-series DB for metrics/events
- Redis for high-frequency messaging layer

### 4. Data Integrity and Consistency
**Question:** Are the constraints and relationships sufficient for data integrity?

**Current Constraints:**
- Foreign keys for referential integrity
- UNIQUE constraints on natural keys (pr_number, agent_id+category+key)
- JSON validation (currently not enforced)

**Missing Constraints Analysis:**
- Should task status transitions be enforced via CHECK constraints?
- Are agent status values properly constrained?
- Should message delivery guarantees be enforced at schema level?

### 5. Memory Management Architecture
**Question:** Is the context_sessions + memory_snapshots design optimal for AI agent memory?

**Current Design:**
- context_sessions tracks active context usage (token counts, usage_percent)
- memory_snapshots stores consolidated memory with importance scoring
- content_hash for deduplication

**Specific Concerns:**
- Will importance_score-based memory pruning work effectively?
- Should memory snapshots be normalized (separate tables for different types)?
- Is JSON storage optimal for large context data vs BLOB compression?

### 6. Event Logging and Observability
**Question:** Does the events table design support comprehensive system observability?

**Current Design:**
- Severity levels (debug, info, warning, error, critical)
- JSON details column for flexible event data
- Correlation_id for tracing related events

**Enhancement Questions:**
- Should we separate high-frequency events (metrics) from system events?
- Is the current indexing strategy optimal for log analysis queries?
- Should event retention be handled at schema level with TTL?

### 7. Migration and Evolution Strategy
**Question:** How should this schema evolve as the system grows?

**Current Flexibility:**
- JSON columns for extensible metadata
- Flexible tagging systems
- Configuration table for runtime changes

**Evolution Concerns:**
- How to handle schema migrations in deployed agent systems?
- Should we implement semantic versioning for schema changes?
- What's the strategy for breaking changes vs backward compatibility?
