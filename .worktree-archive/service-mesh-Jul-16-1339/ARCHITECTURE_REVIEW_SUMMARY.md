# LeanVibe Agent Hive - Architecture Review Summary

## Database Architecture Overview

### System Purpose
Multi-agent orchestration platform for autonomous software development with real-time coordination, memory management, and performance tracking.

### Architecture Decision: Single SQLite Database
**File:** `agent_hive.db` (consolidated from multiple data sources)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Atomic transactions across all agent operations
- ✅ Simplified backup/restore (single file)
- ✅ No database server overhead
- ✅ Excellent read performance for status queries
- ❓ Potential concerns with high concurrent writes

## Schema Architecture Map

```
agents (central hub)
├── agent_messages (communication)
├── tasks (work management)
├── context_sessions (memory state)
├── performance_metrics (analytics)
├── git_state (code tracking)
└── events (system logging)

projects
├── project_tasks (junction)
└── checkpoints (quality gates)

context_sessions
├── memory_snapshots (consolidation)
└── context_events (memory lifecycle)

pull_requests (independent)
configurations (system settings)
```

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Agent-Centric Design
- All major tables link to `agents` as the central entity
- Agent lifecycle drives data retention and cleanup
- Support for multiple agents operating independently

### 2. Hierarchical Task Management
- Parent-child task relationships via `parent_task_id`
- Project grouping via junction table pattern
- Flexible metadata storage with JSON columns

### 3. Memory Management System
- Two-tier: active sessions + consolidated snapshots
- Importance-based pruning with content deduplication
- Configurable retention policies

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
- Comprehensive event logging with correlation IDs
- Severity-based filtering and routing
- JSON details for flexible event data

## Performance Strategy

### Indexing Philosophy
- **Composite indexes** for common query patterns
- **Covering indexes** for frequently accessed data
- **Time-based indexes** for analytics queries

### Query Pattern Optimization
```sql
-- Agent status queries (high frequency)
SELECT * FROM agents WHERE status = 'active';
-- Optimized by: idx_agents_status

-- Message routing (real-time)
SELECT * FROM agent_messages 
WHERE to_agent = ? AND delivered_at IS NULL 
ORDER BY priority, sent_at;
-- Optimized by: idx_messages_recipient

-- Task assignment (coordination)
SELECT * FROM tasks 
WHERE agent_id = ? AND status = 'pending' 
ORDER BY priority, created_at;
-- Optimized by: idx_tasks_agent
```

## Scale Considerations

### Current SQLite Limitations
- **Concurrent writes:** Limited to single writer
- **JSON queries:** Less optimized than PostgreSQL
- **Full-text search:** Basic capabilities
- **Analytics:** Complex aggregations may be slower

### Scaling Strategies
1. **Read replicas** for analytics (SQLite → PostgreSQL sync)
2. **Write optimization** via batched transactions
3. **Hybrid architecture** for high-frequency data
4. **Partitioning** by agent_id or time ranges

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Concurrent write bottlenecks** with 50+ active agents
- **JSON column performance** under heavy query load
- **Database locking** during memory consolidation

### Medium Risk
- **Schema evolution** complexity with deployed agents
- **Backup window** impact during high activity
- **Full-text search** limitations for event analysis

### Low Risk
- **Storage space** growth (SQLite handles large files well)
- **Read performance** (SQLite excels at reads)
- **Transaction integrity** (ACID compliance built-in)

## Alternative Architecture Options

### Option 1: Hybrid Database
```
SQLite (primary):
- agents, tasks, projects, configurations
- Low-latency operational data

PostgreSQL (analytics):
- events, performance_metrics, memory_snapshots
- Complex queries and reporting

Redis (caching):
- agent_messages (high-frequency routing)
- Real-time status updates
```

### Option 2: Full PostgreSQL
```
Benefits:
- Better JSON query performance
- Advanced full-text search
- Better concurrent write handling
- Mature ecosystem

Costs:
- Additional infrastructure complexity
- More complex deployment
- Database server management overhead
```

### Option 3: Microservice Databases
```
Core Service: SQLite
- agents, tasks, projects

Message Service: Redis
- agent_messages (pub/sub)

Analytics Service: PostgreSQL  
- events, performance_metrics

Memory Service: Specialized storage
- context_sessions, memory_snapshots
```

## Recommendation Framework

### For Gemini Review
Use the prepared query templates to get specific feedback on:

1. **Schema Relationships** - Are FK relationships optimal?
2. **Index Strategy** - Missing or suboptimal indexes?
3. **Database Choice** - SQLite vs alternatives for this use case?
4. **Performance Patterns** - Query optimization opportunities?
5. **Evolution Strategy** - How to handle schema changes?

### Implementation Priority
1. **Validate schema design** with Gemini feedback
2. **Prototype performance tests** with realistic data
3. **Implement database manager** with connection pooling
4. **Create migration scripts** from current file-based system
5. **Add monitoring** for performance bottlenecks
