## Working Environment

### Repository Structure
```
/Users/bogdan/work/leanvibe-dev/integration-agent-worktree/
â”œâ”€â”€ external_api/           # API integration modules
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/external_api/     # Integration test suite
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                   # Documentation
â””â”€â”€ personas/integration-agent.yaml  # Agent configuration
```

### Key Files to Work With
- `external_api/api_gateway.py` - Main API gateway implementation
- `external_api/webhook_server.py` - Webhook handling system
- `external_api/event_streaming.py` - Real-time event processing
- `tests/external_api/` - Comprehensive test suite

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Branch Protocol
- Work on feature branch: `feature/integration-agent-sprint`
- Commit after each task completion
- Push to remote after each commit
- Follow quality gates before each commit

### 2. Testing Requirements
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Ensure 90%+ test coverage
- Run full test suite before commits
- Include performance tests for all APIs

### 3. Documentation Standards
- Document all APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Create integration examples
- Update README with setup instructions
- Include troubleshooting guides

## Coordination Protocols

### Daily Check-ins
- **Morning**: Review priorities and blockers
- **Midday**: Progress update and coordination
- **Evening**: Completion summary and next steps

### Cross-Agent Coordination
- **Production Agent**: Infrastructure requirements and deployment
- **Documentation Agent**: API documentation and examples
- **Quality Agent**: Testing strategies and validation

## Escalation Procedures

### Technical Issues
- **Confidence <80%**: Seek clarification or help
- **Architecture Changes**: Coordinate with team lead
- **Security Concerns**: Immediate security review
- **Performance Issues**: Escalate within 2 hours

### Blockers
- **External Service Issues**: Document and workaround
- **Infrastructure Problems**: Coordinate with Production Agent
- **Testing Failures**: Analyze and fix immediately

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow Python best practices and PEP 8
- Use type hints for all functions
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging

### API Standards
- Use FastAPI for high-performance APIs
- Follow RESTful principles
- Implement proper status codes
- Add request/response validation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Performance tests for all APIs
- Security tests for authentication
