### **🎯 Agent Delegation Strategy**

## 🤖 **AGENT ASSIGNMENTS**

### **1. Security Agent** - 🔴 **CRITICAL PRIORITY**
**Mission**: Emergency Security Remediation
- **Objective**: Eliminate all security vulnerabilities in crisis backup
- **Timeline**: 2-4 hours
- **Deliverables**:
  - Security audit report with vulnerability count
  - Fix all exec(), eval() usage
  - Remove hardcoded passwords
  - Secure subprocess calls (no shell=True)
  - Validate against security scanning tools

**Commands**:
```bash
# Send Security Agent mission
python scripts/fixed_agent_communication.py --agent security --message "🚨 CRISIS MISSION: Emergency Security Remediation. Check out main branch (ef5f15f). Audit and fix ALL security vulnerabilities: exec(), eval(), hardcoded passwords, shell=True subprocess calls. Create security_audit_report.md with findings and fixes. Timeline: 2-4 hours. Report progress every hour."
```

### **2. Performance Agent** - 🟠 **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Mission**: Code Quality & System Performance Recovery
- **Objective**: Resolve massive linting errors and system performance issues
- **Timeline**: 4-6 hours
- **Deliverables**:
  - Linting errors reduced by 90%+ (from 47M+)
  - System performance metrics restored
  - Quality gates compliance report
  - Automated fixes for common issues

**Commands**:
```bash
# Send Performance Agent mission
python scripts/fixed_agent_communication.py --agent performance --message "🚨 CRISIS MISSION: Code Quality & Performance Recovery. Check out main branch (ef5f15f). Address 47M+ linting errors using automated tools. Focus on: unused imports, indentation, line length, formatting. Create quality_recovery_report.md with metrics. Timeline: 4-6 hours. Report progress every 2 hours."
```

### **3. PM Agent** - 🔴 **CRITICAL COORDINATION**
**Mission**: Crisis Coordination & Progress Monitoring
- **Objective**: Coordinate crisis response and track progress
- **Timeline**: Continuous throughout crisis
- **Deliverables**:
  - Real-time crisis dashboard
  - Progress tracking and reporting
  - Inter-agent coordination
  - Human escalation management

**Commands**:
```bash
# Send PM Agent mission
python scripts/fixed_agent_communication.py --agent pm-agent-new --message "🚨 CRISIS MISSION: Crisis Coordination & Progress Monitoring. Coordinate emergency response across all agents. Track Security (security fixes) and Performance (code quality) progress. Create crisis_dashboard.md with real-time status. Monitor for conflicts and escalation triggers. Timeline: Continuous. Report status every hour."
```

### **4. Frontend Agent** - 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Mission**: UI/UX Quality & System Visibility
- **Objective**: Ensure user-facing components remain stable
- **Timeline**: 2-4 hours
- **Deliverables**:
  - Frontend quality assessment
  - UI/UX consistency validation
  - System visibility improvements
  - User experience impact analysis

**Commands**:
```bash
# Send Frontend Agent mission
python scripts/fixed_agent_communication.py --agent frontend --message "🚨 CRISIS MISSION: UI/UX Quality & System Visibility. Check out main branch (ef5f15f). Audit frontend components for quality issues. Ensure tmux window naming system works correctly. Create frontend_quality_report.md with findings. Timeline: 2-4 hours. Report progress every 2 hours."
```

## 🎯 **COORDINATION PROTOCOLS**

### **Human Checkpoints** - 🔴 **CRITICAL APPROVAL REQUIRED**
1. **Security Audit Complete** (2-4 hours): Human approval before security fixes merge
2. **Quality Gates 90%+ Passing** (6-8 hours): Human approval for progress assessment
3. **Branch Merge Decision** (12-16 hours): Human approval for emergency→main merge
4. **Sprint Plan Adjustment** (16-24 hours): Human approval for Monday sprint changes

### **Escalation Triggers** - 🚨 **IMMEDIATE HUMAN INTERVENTION**
- Security vulnerabilities not resolved within 4 hours
- Quality gates remain <80% after 8 hours
- Agent coordination conflicts or failures
- Timeline extension beyond 24 hours needed

### **Progress Reporting Schedule**
- **Every 1 hour**: Security Agent + PM Agent status updates
- **Every 2 hours**: Performance Agent + Frontend Agent progress
- **Every 4 hours**: Comprehensive crisis dashboard update
- **Every 8 hours**: Human checkpoint review and approval

## 📊 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Immediate (2-4 hours)**
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities: 0 (from current unknown count)
- ✅ Agent coordination: All 4 agents actively working
- ✅ Human checkpoints: Security audit approval obtained
- ✅ Quality gates: Security passing 100%

### **Short-term (6-8 hours)**
- ✅ Linting errors: <5M (90% reduction from 47M+)
- ✅ Quality gates: 90%+ passing
- ✅ System performance: Restored to normal levels
- ✅ Agent coordination: Smooth collaboration

### **Medium-term (12-16 hours)**
- ✅ Quality gates: 100% passing
- ✅ PR size: <500 lines (from 538K+)
- ✅ Branch merger: emergency→main successful
- ✅ Sprint readiness: Monday sprint plan updated
