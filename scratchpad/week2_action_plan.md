# Week 2 Action Plan: Workflow Discipline Crisis Response

## Current Situation Analysis

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issues
1. **Security Agent** creating 16K+ line PRs despite enforcement (PR #91, #90)
2. **Frontend Agent** stuck in exploration (343s, 12.2k tokens) 
3. **Workflow discipline breakdown** - agents ignoring established limits
4. **PM Agent** just deployed for enforcement (30 min timeline)

### ðŸ“Š Previous Actions Taken
- Closed 4 oversized PRs with workflow explanations
- Established <500 line limits as non-negotiable
- Consulted Gemini CLI on enforcement approach
- Spawned new PM Agent with enforcement authority

## Strategic Options Analysis

### Option A: Wait and Monitor (Conservative)
**Approach:** Let PM Agent handle enforcement over next 30 minutes
- **Pros:** Maintains delegation structure, tests PM Agent effectiveness
- **Cons:** May allow continued violations, time-sensitive
- **Timeline:** 30 minutes

### Option B: Direct Intervention (Aggressive)
**Approach:** Immediately close new PRs and directly message agents
- **Pros:** Immediate compliance, clear message
- **Cons:** Bypasses PM Agent, may undermine delegation
- **Timeline:** 10 minutes

### Option C: Strategic Pause (Reset)
**Approach:** Pause all agent work, fix coordination system first
- **Pros:** Addresses root cause, prevents further violations
- **Cons:** Delays Week 2 progress, may indicate strategy failure
- **Timeline:** 2-4 hours

### Option D: Escalated Enforcement (Hybrid)
**Approach:** PM Agent enforcement + direct intervention if needed
- **Pros:** Multi-layered approach, maintains delegation while ensuring compliance
- **Cons:** Complex coordination, potential confusion
- **Timeline:** 30-60 minutes

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (0-30 minutes)
1. **Monitor PM Agent progress** - Give PM Agent 30 minutes to enforce
2. **Prepare direct intervention** - Ready to close PRs if PM Agent fails
3. **Check Frontend Agent** - Verify if stuck or making progress

### Phase 2: Escalation (30-60 minutes)
1. **Evaluate PM Agent effectiveness** - Did violations get addressed?
2. **Direct intervention if needed** - Close PRs, enforce limits directly
3. **Agent briefing revision** - Improve communication if pattern continues

### Phase 3: Strategic Assessment (60+ minutes)
1. **Root cause analysis** - Why are agents not following workflow?
2. **Strategy revision** - Adjust approach based on evidence
3. **Week 2 plan adjustment** - Modify timeline/approach if needed

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All oversized PRs closed within 60 minutes
- [ ] Security Agent compliance restored
- [ ] Frontend Agent unstuck and productive
- [ ] No new PR violations for 2+ hours
- [ ] PM Agent proving effective at enforcement

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Continued violations indicate fundamental strategy failure
- **Medium Risk:** Agent coordination system needs improvement
- **Low Risk:** Temporary discipline issue, correctable with enforcement

## Escalation Triggers
- PM Agent fails to address violations in 30 minutes
- New violations occur after enforcement
- Multiple agents become non-responsive
- Frontend Agent confirmed stuck (>1 hour exploration)

## Questions for Gemini CLI
1. Is our enforcement approach fundamentally flawed?
2. Should we pause agent work to fix coordination?
3. Are we expecting too much from agents with <500 line limits?
4. Is the delegation structure working or should we intervene directly?
