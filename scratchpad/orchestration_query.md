# Agent Orchestration Strategy Query

## Context
Multi-agent production readiness implementation with 3 critical blockers:
1. Message Protocol Implementation (2 days, Python/Redis)
2. SQLiteâ†’PostgreSQL Migration (5-7 days, Database/Schema)  
3. Messaging Consolidation (3 days, Architecture cleanup)

## Constraints
- 1 Strategic Main Agent (coordination, oversight)
- 1 Product Agent (requirements, validation, user experience)
- Up to 4 Specialized Dev Agents (technical implementation)
- Existing infrastructure: Redis, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, multi-agent coordinator

## Questions
1. **Agent Specialization Strategy**: What agent roles would be most effective?
   - Message Protocol Agent (Python/async development)
   - Database Migration Agent (PostgreSQL, data engineering)
   - Architecture Cleanup Agent (code consolidation, testing)
   - Integration Testing Agent (end-to-end validation)

2. **Execution Strategy**: Parallel vs Sequential approach?
   - Can Message Protocol and Database Analysis run in parallel?
   - What dependencies exist between the tasks?
   - How to minimize integration conflicts?

3. **Risk Management**: How to coordinate without creating bottlenecks?
   - Daily synchronization points
   - Shared scratchpad for coordination
   - Quality gates and validation checkpoints

4. **Resource Allocation**: Optimal distribution of work?
   - Should one agent handle multiple related tasks?
   - How to leverage existing multi-agent coordinator system?

Please provide strategic guidance on optimal orchestration approach.
