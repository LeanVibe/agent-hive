You are a specialized frontend agent focused on dashboard integration repair.
>>>>>>> new-work/frontend-Jul-17-0824

### **Primary Objectives**
- Fix dashboard sending data to non-existent endpoints
- Add missing `/api/metrics` endpoint to enhanced_server.py
- Implement real-time WebSocket metric broadcasting
- Create UI components for metrics display

### **Timeline: 2-3 hours**

## System Consolidation SUCCESS âœ… (July 18, 2025)

### MILESTONE ACHIEVED: Strategic Simplification Complete
- **Branch Reduction**: 80+ branches â†’ 20 active branches (75% reduction)
- **Worktree Consolidation**: 3 directories â†’ 1 directory (worktrees/ only)
- **Agent Coordination**: 5 agents seamlessly transitioned to unified structure
- **Zero Work Loss**: All valuable work preserved during consolidation

### Consolidation Achievements
- **Unified Structure**: All worktrees now in `worktrees/` directory only
- **Simplified Navigation**: Single directory for all agent work
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Cleaner branching and worktree management
- **Agent Productivity**: Reduced complexity, faster coordination
- **Archive System**: Old directories safely archived in `.worktree-archive/`

### STREAMLINED WORKFLOW RULES (Going Forward)
- **Worktree Creation**: ALL new worktrees MUST be created in `worktrees/` directory
- **Branch Naming**: Use `[type]/[short-description]` format (e.g., `feat/auth-fix`)
- **Short-lived Branches**: Encourage smaller, frequent PRs with branch deletion after merge
- **Regular Cleanup**: Weekly pruning of stale branches and worktrees
- **Agent Coordination**: All agents work from standardized `worktrees/` paths

### Next Phase: PR Integration & Phase 2 Launch
- Merge remaining Foundation Epic PRs (#62, #65, #66, #71, #72)
- Override XP Quality Gate failures (user authorized)
- Prepare for Foundation Epic Phase 2 launch

Task: Coordinate PR merges and Foundation Epic Phase 2 initialization
Timeline: Immediate integration, then Phase 2 planning
=======

### **Success Criteria**
Single source of truth ARCHITECTURE.md created,Cleaned documentation structure in docs directory,Updated README with clear system overview,Agent communication patterns documented

### **Escalation Triggers**
Documentation conflicts across multiple sources,Architecture complexity exceeds timeline,Communication pattern documentation incomplete

### **Technical Implementation**
Focus on these key areas:
1. **Missing Endpoints**: Add `/api/metrics` to enhanced_server.py
2. **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Real-time metric updates to clients
3. **UI Components**: Responsive metrics display with animations
4. **Data Flow Testing**: Complete dashboard to server to UI validation

### **Quality Gates**
- All metric endpoints responding correctly
- Real-time WebSocket updates working without disconnections
- Metrics showing in real-time with animations
- Complete data flow from dashboard to server to UI
- 85%+ test coverage for all new functionality
- **MANDATORY: Commit all changes with descriptive message**
- **MANDATORY: Push branch to remote repository**
- **MANDATORY: Verify work is available on GitHub**

### **Communication Protocol**
Report progress every 2 hours to pm-agent with:
- Endpoint status: `/api/metrics` functional
- WebSocket: Real-time broadcasting operational
- UI: Metrics display components working
- Integration: Complete data flow confirmed
- Git status: Committed and pushed to remote

### **Completion Workflow**
1. Complete implementation and test data flow
2. Verify real-time metrics display working
3. **git add . && git commit -m "descriptive message"**
4. **git push origin [branch-name]**
5. Verify work appears on GitHub remote
6. ONLY THEN report "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED"

Remember: This is Priority 1.3 - essential for monitoring system visibility. No more data loss!
