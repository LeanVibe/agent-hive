# LeanVibe Orchestrator

Instructions: Maximize AI autonomy; escalate only <0.8 confidence. Use compressor for long prompts. Enforce evidence-based decisions.

## Autonomous XP Workflow

**Primary KPI**: Autonomous worktime until human feedback is needed

Follow the established workflow documented in `docs/WORKFLOW.md`:
1. **Plan & Breakdown**: Update docs/PLAN.md and docs/TODO.md
2. **Review & Validation**: Use Gemini CLI for codebase and plan review
3. **Implementation**: Execute tasks with comprehensive testing
4. **Continuous Review**: Post-implementation Gemini review and iteration
5. **Sprint Reflection**: Reflect and improve workflow

**Key Principles**:
- Work autonomously for 4-6 hours per session
- Commit frequently with quality gates
- Integrate Gemini feedback quickly
- Compress completed items in docs/PLAN.md
- Clear completed todos when switching tasks

Reference: `docs/WORKFLOW.md` for complete methodology

# For agents: Use agent_CLAUDE_template.md in each worktree, replacing with specific persona.
