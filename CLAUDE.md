# LeanVibe Agent Hive - Project Context

## Project Overview
LeanVibe Agent Hive is a production-ready AI orchestration system for autonomous development through intelligent coordination of specialized AI agents.

## Current Status
**Production Ready**: Foundation Epic Phase 2 Complete
- âœ… Multi-Agent Coordination operational with 10+ agent support
- âœ… Service Discovery and API Gateway production-ready
- âœ… Performance optimization with <500ms response times
- âœ… Security framework with JWT authentication and RBAC
- âœ… Quality gates with comprehensive automated validation

## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow
- **Feature Branches**: Use descriptive names (`feature/add-new-agent-type`)
- **Worktrees**: Create in `worktrees/` directory for isolation
- **Quality Gates**: All commits must pass automated testing and security scans

## Next Phase: Foundation Epic Phase 2 Launch

### **Phase 2 Focus Areas**
- **Advanced Systems**: External integration and service mesh completion
- **Security & Authentication**: JWT, RBAC, and comprehensive security framework
- **Production Readiness**: DevOps, infrastructure, and deployment automation
- **External API Integration**: Complete API Gateway and service discovery

### **Open Issues for Phase 2**
- **Issue #73**: Foundation Epic Phase 2 - Advanced Systems & External Integration
- **Issue #77/75**: Security & Authentication Implementation (needs consolidation)
- **Issue #21**: Production Agent Sprint - DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Issues #7-10**: Ongoing documentation and technical debt work

### **Next Actions**
1. **Phase 2 Sprint Planning**: Consolidate Phase 2 issues and create execution plan
2. **Agent Coordination**: Spawn specialized agents for Phase 2 work
3. **Worktree Management**: All new worktrees in `worktrees/` directory only
4. **Quality Maintenance**: Ensure Phase 1 achievements are maintained

Task: Coordinate Foundation Epic Phase 2 initialization and execution
Timeline: Multi-week structured development with improved coordination

## Quality Standards Maintained
- **System Integration**: 100% successful
- **Code Quality**: No technical debt accumulated
- **Testing**: All systems validated
- **Documentation**: Accurate and up-to-date
- **Security**: Hardened against common vulnerabilities

## Lessons Learned from Phase 1
- **Conflict Prevention**: Better agent coordination needed
- **Worktree Management**: Standardized structure required (now implemented)
- **Integration Strategy**: Sequential integration works better than parallel
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation prevents integration issues

Ready for Foundation Epic Phase 2 with improved coordination and standardized processes. ðŸš€
