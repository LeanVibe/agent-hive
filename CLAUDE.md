## Technical Requirements
- **Testing**: pytest, unittest, integration testing frameworks
- **Security**: bandit, safety, OWASP tools
- **Performance**: locust, k6, profiling tools
- **Quality**: pylint, mypy, sonarqube, codecov
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, custom dashboards

## Workflow Protocol
1. **Feature Branch**: Work on `feature/quality-testing-validation`
2. **Commit Frequently**: After each major quality milestone
3. **Quality Gates**: Validate all quality checks before commits
4. **Push Immediately**: Push commits to maintain visibility
5. **Coordination**: Sync with other agents on quality requirements

## Escalation Thresholds
- **Confidence < 80%**: Escalate to Orchestrator
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Escalate immediately
- **Performance degradation**: Require immediate attention
- **Quality gate failures**: Escalate for resolution

## Progress Reporting

- Commit progress with detailed quality metrics
- Coordinate with other agents on quality requirements
- Report quality incidents immediately

## Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Security scans must show zero critical vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks must be within acceptable ranges
- Code quality metrics must meet minimum standards
- Test coverage must be above 95%

## Testing Standards
- Follow TDD/BDD practices where applicable
- Implement proper test isolation and cleanup
- Use meaningful test names and descriptions
