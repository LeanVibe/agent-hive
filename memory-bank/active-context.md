# Active Context & Next Steps

## 1. Current Work Focus

The immediate and primary focus is on **resolving the final two conflicting pull requests** to complete the major integration effort. The project is blocked until these are merged.

## 2. Active Blockers

1.  ðŸ”´ **PR #35: API Gateway component**
    *   **Branch**: `feature/api-gateway-component`
    *   **Status**: CONFLICTING
    *   **Assigned**: `quality-agent`

2.  ðŸ”´ **PR #38: Monitoring System component**
    *   **Branch**: `feature/monitoring-system-component`
    *   **Status**: CONFLICTING
    *   **Assigned**: `documentation-agent`

## 3. Next Actions (Immediate)

1.  **Monitor Agent Progress**: The `pm-agent` is currently monitoring the `quality-agent` and `documentation-agent` for progress on conflict resolution.
2.  **Wait for Escalation**: If the agents cannot resolve the conflicts, they are expected to use the agent communication system to escalate the issue to the `pm-agent`.
3.  **Prepare for Manual Intervention**: If no escalation occurs within the next ~30 minutes (from the time of the last report), the next step is to proceed with manual conflict resolution as outlined in `FINAL_PR_MERGE_STATUS.md`.
4.  **Complete Worktree Cleanup**: After the final two PRs are merged, the remaining agent worktrees must be cleaned up and the agents despawned.
