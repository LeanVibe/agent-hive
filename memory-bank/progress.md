# Project Progress Report

## 1. Overall Status

**The project is approximately 82% complete and is in the final stage of a major integration effort.**

The core intelligence framework, documentation ecosystem, and quality assurance systems are fully implemented and operational. A significant integration of 9 major components has been successfully completed. The project is currently blocked by two final pull requests that require conflict resolution.

## 2. What Works

*   **Core Orchestration**: The multi-agent coordination system is functional.
*   **Intelligence Framework**: The ML-based decision-making, task allocation, and performance monitoring systems are complete.
*   **Merged Components (9/11)**:
    *   Dashboard Integration
    *   Velocity Tracking & Sprint Planning
    *   Orchestration & Coordination
    *   Quality Gates & Security
    *   Documentation Ecosystem
    *   Intelligence Framework
    *   Auth Middleware
    *   Service Discovery
*   **Agent Communication**: The foundational agent-to-agent messaging protocol is implemented and in use.
*   **Automated Quality & Documentation**: Audits, validation scripts, and testing frameworks are 100% complete and operational.

## 3. What's Left to Build

### Immediate Blockers
*   **Resolve Conflicting PRs**:
    1.  ðŸ”´ **PR #35**: API Gateway component
    2.  ðŸ”´ **PR #38**: Monitoring System component

### Missing Infrastructure
*   **Message Queue System**: A persistent message queue with acknowledgments.
*   **Agent Capability Registry**: A database of agent skills and specializations.
*   **Automated Conflict Detection**: A system to automatically detect conflicting agent goals.
*   **Conversation History**: Threaded message history between agents.
*   **Human Notification Integration**: Slack/email integration for escalations.
*   **Missing Scripts**:
    *   `scripts/view_agent_conversations.py`
    *   `scripts/agent_capabilities.py`
    *   `scripts/detect_agent_conflicts.py`

## 4. Current Issues & Risks

*   **Integration Stalemate**: The two conflicting PRs are halting final project completion. The assigned agents may not be able to resolve the conflicts autonomously.
*   **Manual Intervention Risk**: If the agents do not resolve the conflicts or escalate within a short timeframe, manual intervention will be required, which could introduce delays or errors.
*   **Incomplete Agent Communication System**: The lack of a persistent message queue and conversation history limits the robustness and observability of agent interactions.
