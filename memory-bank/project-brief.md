# Project Brief: LeanVibe Agent Hive

## 1. Project Statement

LeanVibe Agent Hive is a production-ready, AI-driven orchestration system designed to achieve autonomous software development. It uses a coordinated group of specialized AI agents, powered by Claude and other models, to manage complex development workflows with minimal human intervention.

## 2. Core Goals & Objectives

*   **Autonomy**: Enable end-to-end development cycles—from planning and coding to testing and deployment—to be executed by AI agents.
*   **Quality**: Enforce high-quality standards through automated testing, validation, and adherence to Extreme Programming (XP) principles.
*   **Velocity**: Accelerate development speed by parallelizing tasks and leveraging AI for rapid implementation.
*   **Intelligence**: Utilize an advanced intelligence layer with machine learning to optimize workflows, predict issues, and continuously improve agent performance.

## 3. Scope

The system's scope covers the entire software development lifecycle:

*   **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestration of specialized agents for tasks like backend, frontend, database management, testing, and DevOps.
*   **Intelligence Framework**: Core decision-making, task allocation, and performance monitoring.
*   **External API Integration**: A robust API gateway and webhook system to connect with external services and data sources.
*   **Developer Experience**: A comprehensive CLI for managing the agent hive, alongside extensive documentation and tutorials.

## 4. Target Audience

This project is for software development teams and organizations looking to:
*   Automate repetitive and complex development tasks.
*   Scale their development capacity without a linear increase in team size.
*   Improve code quality and consistency through AI-driven enforcement of best practices.
*   Rapidly prototype and build production-ready applications.
