# System Patterns & Architecture

## 1. Core Architectural Pattern: Orchestrator-Agent Model

The system is built on an **Orchestrator-Agent** model. A central `MultiAgentCoordinator` acts as the brain, managing the lifecycle and task distribution for a hive of specialized, single-purpose agents.

*   **Orchestrator (`MultiAgentCoordinator`)**: The central hub responsible for:
    *   Agent registration, health monitoring, and discovery.
    *   Task distribution based on intelligent load balancing.
    *   Resource management and auto-scaling.
    *   Coordinating communication between agents.

*   **Agents**: Specialized instances (e.g., `backend`, `frontend`, `testing`, `docs`) that perform specific tasks. They register with the orchestrator and report their capabilities and status.

## 2. Key System Components

*   **`ResourceManager`**: A dedicated component that tracks and allocates system resources (CPU, memory, disk) to prevent overload and optimize usage.
*   **`ScalingManager`**: Handles the auto-scaling of agents, adding or removing instances based on demand, queue depth, and performance metrics.
*   **`IntelligenceFramework`**: A layer of ML-powered components that provide confidence scoring, predictive analytics, and adaptive learning to optimize the entire system's performance.

## 3. Communication Patterns

*   **Agent Registration Protocol**: Agents announce their presence, capabilities, and resource needs to the orchestrator upon startup.
*   **Task Assignment Protocol**: The orchestrator assigns tasks to agents with a clear contract, including task data, priority, and resource allocations.
*   **Health Check Protocol**: Agents periodically send heartbeats and status updates (health, resource usage, active tasks) to the orchestrator, enabling fault tolerance.

## 4. Recurring Design Strategies

*   **Load Balancing**: The system employs multiple strategies to distribute work efficiently:
    *   **Round Robin**: Simple, sequential distribution.
    *   **Least Connections**: Favors agents with the fewest active tasks.
    *   **Resource-Based**: Assigns tasks to agents with the most available resources.
    *   **Capability-Based**: Routes tasks to the most qualified agent.
    *   **Weighted Distribution**: Prioritizes agents based on historical performance.

*   **Fault Tolerance**: The system is designed for resilience through:
    *   **Continuous Health Monitoring**: The orchestrator actively monitors agent heartbeats and error rates.
    *   **Automatic Recovery**: On agent failure, the system automatically restarts the agent or reassigns its tasks to a healthy one.
    *   **Graceful Degradation**: The system can continue to function in a limited capacity if some components fail.

*   **State Management**: System and agent state are persisted in a database, allowing for checkpointing and recovery from shutdowns or failures.

*   **CLI as Primary Interface**: All system interactions, from starting workflows to monitoring progress, are handled through a robust, well-documented command-line interface (`cli.py`).
