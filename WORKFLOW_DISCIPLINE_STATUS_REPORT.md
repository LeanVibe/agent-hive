# Security Agent Workflow Discipline Status Report

## Issue Resolution Summary

### Problem Identified
- Security agent was working on `main` branch instead of proper feature branch

1. **Branch Correction**: âœ… COMPLETE
   - Switched security agent from `main` to `new-work/security-Jul-17-0944`
   - Proper feature branch now active for security work

2. **Workflow Discipline Establishment**: âœ… COMPLETE
   - Created workflow discipline commit (dac5ae4)
   - Established remote tracking for feature branch
   - Push discipline restored with successful remote push

3. **Repository Status**: âœ… VERIFIED
   - Security agent now properly isolated on feature branch
   - Clean working tree with no uncommitted changes
   - Branch tracking configured: `new-work/security-Jul-17-0944` tracks `origin/new-work/security-Jul-17-0944`
