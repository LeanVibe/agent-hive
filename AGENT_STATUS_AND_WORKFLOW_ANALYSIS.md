## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **1. No PRs for Recent Work**
- **Issue**: Significant work completed but no PRs created
- **Files Created**: 13 new analysis and implementation files
- **Impact**: Work not integrated into main codebase

### **2. Branch Confusion**
- **Issue**: Currently on `emergency/clean-recovery` but should be on `integration/phase3-advanced-features`
- **Impact**: Work done on wrong branch, not aligned with main integration

### **3. Missing Development Protocol**
- **Issue**: No clear workflow for agent coordination ‚Üí branch creation ‚Üí PR creation
- **Impact**: Agents working in isolation without integration path

### **4. Agent Deliverable Gap**
- **Issue**: Agents claiming completion but no visible deliverables in repository
- **Impact**: Work not persisted or integrated

## üéØ **WORKFLOW PROTOCOL ANALYSIS**

### **Expected Workflow (Based on Historical PRs)**
1. **Agent Work**: Agents complete tasks in their worktrees
2. **Branch Creation**: Create feature branches for specific work
3. **Commit Changes**: Commit work to feature branches
4. **PR Creation**: Create PRs for review and integration
5. **Integration**: Merge into main integration branch

### **Current Workflow Gap**
1. **Agent Work**: ‚úÖ Agents are active and working
2. **Branch Creation**: ‚ùå No new branches created for current work
3. **Commit Changes**: ‚ùå No commits made for current work
4. **PR Creation**: ‚ùå No PRs created for current work
5. **Integration**: ‚ùå No integration happening

## üîÑ **GITHUB ISSUES ANALYSIS**

### **Issue Status Requirements**
- Need to audit all GitHub issues for current status
- Update issue labels and milestones
- Close completed issues
- Create new issues for ongoing work

### **Historical Pattern**
- Recent PRs show consistent pattern of agent work ‚Üí PR creation
- PRs typically have descriptive titles and agent identification
- Work is organized by agent type and date

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Commit Current Work (30 minutes)**
1. **Review all created files** for quality and completeness
2. **Commit work to emergency/clean-recovery** branch
3. **Create PR for current work** (CLAUDE.md recreation, communication fixes)

### **Phase 2: Branch Strategy (15 minutes)**
1. **Switch to integration/phase3-advanced-features** branch
2. **Merge emergency work** into integration branch
3. **Establish clear branching strategy** for agent work

### **Phase 3: Agent Coordination (45 minutes)**
1. **Collect agent status** from all communications sent
2. **Identify agent deliverables** that need PRs
3. **Create agent-specific branches** for ongoing work
4. **Establish PR creation protocol**

### **Phase 4: GitHub Issues Audit (60 minutes)**
1. **Review all open issues** for current status
2. **Update issue labels** based on current work
3. **Close completed issues**
4. **Create new issues** for ongoing agent work

## üîç **QUESTIONS FOR GEMINI CLI EVALUATION**

### **Workflow Questions**
1. **Is the current emergency/clean-recovery branch approach correct?**
2. **Should we switch to integration/phase3-advanced-features branch?**
3. **What is the optimal branching strategy for multi-agent coordination?**

### **Development Protocol Questions**
1. **How should agent work be organized into PRs?**
2. **Should each agent have dedicated branches or shared integration?**
3. **What is the optimal workflow for agent coordination ‚Üí PR creation?**

### **Integration Questions**
1. **How should we handle the current uncommitted work?**
2. **What is the best way to integrate agent work into main codebase?**
