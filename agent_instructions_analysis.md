   - Profile CLI command execution times
   - Analyze memory usage patterns
   - Identify I/O bottlenecks
   - Benchmark critical operations

2. **Security Assessment**
   - Review authentication/authorization code
   - Analyze input validation patterns
   - Check for common security vulnerabilities
   - Assess external dependency security

### Phase 4: Implementation and Validation (Hours 25-32)
1. **High-Impact Improvements**
   - Implement critical bug fixes
   - Refactor high-impact technical debt
   - Optimize performance bottlenecks
   - Enhance security where needed

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - Ensure all changes maintain functionality
   - Add tests for refactored code
   - Validate performance improvements
   - Document all changes and improvements

## üîç Analysis Tools and Techniques

### Static Analysis Tools
```bash
# Python code quality
pylint src/ --output-format=json
flake8 src/ --max-line-length=100
mypy src/ --strict

# Security scanning
bandit -r src/ -f json

# Dependency analysis
safety check
pip-audit
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
# Profile Python code
python -m cProfile -o profile.stats script.py
python -c "import pstats; pstats.Stats('profile.stats').sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(20)"

# Memory profiling
python -m memory_profiler script.py
```

### Metrics Collection
