- Target outcome: 3 qualified Notion prospects

#### **Day 3: Linear + Vercel + PlanetScale**
**Complete Tier 1 research**
- Linear: Focus on small team efficiency (target: 2 prospects)
- Vercel: Focus on frontend/edge deployment complexity (target: 2 prospects)  
- PlanetScale: Focus on database deployment coordination (target: 2 prospects)
- Target outcome: 6 additional qualified prospects (12 total)

### **Phase 2: Initial Outreach (Days 4-8)**

#### **Outreach Strategy**
**Batch Approach**: Contact 2-3 prospects daily for systematic tracking

**Day 4-5**: First 5 prospects (highest priority)
- Use personalized "Deployment Pain Recognition" template
- Send LinkedIn messages with specific company/role customization
- Track send times and response patterns

**Day 6-8**: Next 5 prospects  
- Adjust templates based on initial response patterns
- Mix channels: LinkedIn primary, Twitter secondary
- Continue systematic tracking

#### **Sample Day 4 Execution**
**Target**: 2 Stripe Platform Engineers

**Morning (9-10 AM)**:
1. **Final Profile Review**: Confirm pain point evidence, best contact approach
2. **Message Customization**: Personalize template with specific Stripe infrastructure challenges
3. **Send Messages**: LinkedIn outreach with deployment coordination focus

**Afternoon Follow-up**:
4. **Twitter Engagement**: If they're active on Twitter, engage with relevant technical posts
5. **Tracking Update**: Record outreach in OUTREACH_TRACKING.md
6. **Next Day Prep**: Research next prospects for Day 5

### **Phase 3: Demo Delivery (Days 9-21)**

#### **Demo Request Handling**
**Response Time**: Within 4 hours of demo request  
**Scheduling**: Offer 3 time options within 48 hours  
**Preparation**: Customize demo for their specific deployment scenarios

#### **Demo Delivery Process**
1. **Pre-Demo Research**: Understand their current deployment process
2. **Live Demo**: 10-minute focused demonstration
   - Manual process simulation (2 minutes)
   - Agent Hive autonomous deployment (5 minutes)  
   - Failure recovery demonstration (3 minutes)
3. **Discovery Conversation**: Deep dive into their pain points
4. **Feedback Collection**: Quantified insights about current process
