Technical Stack: Infrastructure as Code, deployment automation, monitoring
Scope: Automating and scaling infrastructure processes

=== PAIN POINT EVIDENCE ===
Recent Discussion Thread (2 weeks ago):
Replied to DevOps community post about scaling challenges:
"We're going through this exact transition at Notion. Manual processes that 
worked at 50 engineers don't work at 150+. Deployment coordination especially 
becomes a full-time job instead of an automated process."

LinkedIn Comment (1 week ago):
On post about infrastructure scaling: "The hardest part about hypergrowth is 
that your infrastructure processes need to evolve faster than you can 
implement them. Deployment coordination is usually the first thing that breaks."

Podcast Interview: "DevOps at Hypergrowth Companies" (Infrastructure Podcast)
- Discussed challenges of scaling deployment processes
- Mentioned coordination bottlenecks as common scaling failure point

=== ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY ===
Best Contact: LinkedIn (active in DevOps discussions)
Personalization Angle: Her comments about scaling deployment coordination
