ðŸš€ URGENT: PR #38 Monitoring System Conflict Resolution

CRITICAL MISSION: Resolve the complex merge conflicts preventing PR #38 from merging and complete the monitoring system component integration.

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. git checkout feature/monitoring-system-component
2. git status (check current conflicts)
3. git diff (understand conflict areas)
4. git rebase main (start conflict resolution)

KEY CONFLICT AREAS:
- observability/__init__.py - Module initialization conflicts (merge both systems)
- .claude/logs/leanvibe.log - Log file conflicts (accept latest/main version)
- Other observability-related files

RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
- Preserve ALL existing observability functionality
- Merge monitoring system WITH existing observability (don't replace)
- Test integration thoroughly before marking complete
- Use existing patterns and conventions

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All merge conflicts resolved in PR #38
- Monitoring system tests pass
- Integration with existing observability confirmed
- PR #38 successfully merged
- No existing functionality broken

TIMELINE: 2-4 hours maximum

COMMUNICATION: Report progress every 30 minutes to pm-agent

ESCALATION: If unable to resolve conflicts after 2 hours, escalate immediately

This is blocking ALL production readiness work - highest priority task!
