🚨 URGENT: RESUME WORK IMMEDIATELY

Hello {agent_name}! You need to resume work immediately. Here are your instructions:

1. **NEVER STOP WORKING** unless you are:
   - Waiting for human feedback/approval
   - Blocked by missing dependencies
   - Need something prepared by another agent

2. **WORK CONTINUOUSLY** on your assigned tasks from your CLAUDE.md file

3. **PUSH AFTER EVERY COMMIT**:
   - After each task completion, commit your changes
   - Immediately push your feature branch: `git push origin <your-feature-branch>`
   - This ensures your work is visible and backed up

4. **REPORT PROGRESS** every 2 hours in your GitHub issue

5. **COORDINATE** with other agents as needed

6. **CURRENT STATUS**: Resume your work on your current task immediately

START WORKING NOW! Do not wait for further instructions. Begin with your next task and maintain continuous progress.

Type your response and press Enter to acknowledge and begin working.
